Our main model is stored in strongbaseline.pt and is run through strongbaseline.py (not through the command line). These two files must be in the same directory for the program to run properly. The strongbaseline.py file is preconfigured to run in evaluation mode. To evaluate a news dataset, the dataset must have the article text stored in a column named 'text'. From there, run the program and the Python console will prompt you to enter the file path to the dataset CSV. The program will automatically split the file into training, validation, and test subsets, and will generate a variable 'pred' that contains its predictions on the test set. If the CSV file also contains a column 'label' with 0 as true news and 1 as fake news, the program will also print an accuracy score based on its predictions and the true labels. Finally, the program will save its predictions to a CSV file called 'test_predictions.csv'. If you wish to generate predictions on the whole dataset, change 'df_test' in the argument of evaluate() on line 213 to 'df'. If you wish to train a new model, uncomment lines 207-212 and comment out line 213.
